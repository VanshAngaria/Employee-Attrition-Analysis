## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze factors contributing to employee attrition and build a machine learning model to predict attrition. The code includes data visualization using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`, as well as a machine learning model using `scikit-learn` and `imbalanced-learn`.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imbalanced-learn`

You can install these packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib plotly scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
